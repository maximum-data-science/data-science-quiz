This quiz is meant as a quick test and as a preparation for data science interviews.

The questions and answers can also be used with [Anki](https://ankiweb.net), an open source
spaced repetition software.

It was created by using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. The source code can be found at [Github]({{ site.github-repository }}).

The main documentation website [Maximum Data Science]({{ site.main-website }}) shows more projects centered around data science. If you find errors or if you have suggestions for interesting projects, you can contact me via [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
